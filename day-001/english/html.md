### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
is the core language used to create and design web pages. It is structured using elements (tags) that define how the content will be displayed in the browser. Below is a comprehensive summary of HTML with examples:

### 1. **Basic Structure of an HTML Document**
Every HTML page starts with a document that follows a specific structure.
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Explanation:
- `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Defines the document type, which is essential to let the browser know that this is an HTML5 page.
- `<html>`: The element that wraps all the content of the page.
- `<head>`: Contains metadata such as character encoding (`charset`) and the title of the page (`title`).
- `<body>`: Contains the content that is displayed in the browser.

---

### 2. **Headings**
Headings are used to organize content hierarchically.
```html
<h1>This is a main heading</h1>
<h2>This is a subheading</h2>
<h3>This is a less important heading</h3>
```
#### Explanation:
- Headings from `<h1>` to `<h6>` define the importance of the heading, where `<h1>` is the most important and `<h6>` is the least.

---

### 3. **Paragraphs**
```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

#### Explanation:
- The `<p>` element is used to add text in the form of paragraphs.

---

### 4. **Links**
```html
<a href="https://example.com">Click here to visit Example</a>
```

#### Explanation:
- The `<a>` element is used to create links. The `href` attribute contains the URL to which the link points.

---

### 5. **Images**
```html
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
```

#### Explanation:
- The `<img>` element is used to insert images. The `src` attribute refers to the image source, and the `alt` is alternative text that appears if the image fails to load.

---

### 6. **Lists**
#### Unordered Lists:
```html
<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
```
#### Ordered Lists:
```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

#### Explanation:
- Unordered lists (`<ul>`) with items (`<li>`) create lists without numbers.
- Ordered lists (`<ol>`) create numbered lists.

---

### 7. **Tables**
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Header 1</th>
    <th>Header 2</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data 1</td>
    <td>Data 2</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

#### Explanation:
- The `<table>` element is used to create a table.
- `<tr>` represents a row.
- `<th>` is a table header.
- `<td>` is a table cell.

---

### 8. **Forms**
Forms are used to gather input from users.
```html
<form action="/submit" method="POST">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
  
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email">
  
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

#### Explanation:
- The `<form>` element represents a form to collect data.
- `action` specifies the destination where the data is sent.
- `method` defines the type of request (GET or POST).
- `label` and `input` collect input from the user.

---

### 10. **HTML Comments**
```html
<!-- This is a comment that doesn't appear in the browser -->
```

#### Explanation:
- Comments are used to add notes within the code, without appearing in the final page.

---

### 12. **Text Formatting**
```html
<strong>Bold text</strong>
<em>Italic text</em>
```

#### Explanation:
- `<strong>` is used to bold text.
- `<em>` is used to italicize text.

---

### Conclusion
HTML is a structural language that builds the foundation of a web page. It doesn't handle styling (handled by CSS) or behavior (handled by JavaScript), but it provides the skeleton of the website.

---
### HTML5

### 1. **Semantic Elements in HTML5**
HTML5 introduced many semantic elements that make the page's structure clearer and easier to understand for both users and search engines.

#### Example of HTML5 Semantic Elements:
```html
<header>This is the page header</header>
<nav>This is the navigation bar</nav>
<main>
  <article>
    <h2>Article Title</h2>
    <p>This article contains important content.</p>
  </article>
  <aside>Sidebar information or advertisements</aside>
</main>
<footer>This is the page footer</footer>
```

- `<header>`: Represents the header of the page or a section.
- `<nav>`: Represents the navigation bar containing important links.
- `<main>`: Contains the main content of the page.
- `<article>`: Represents an independent or self-contained content.
- `<aside>`: Used for side content, like ads or related links.
- `<footer>`: Contains footer information, such as copyright.

### 2. **Multimedia Elements in HTML5**
HTML5 introduced new tags to natively support multimedia content, allowing video and audio to be played without third-party plugins like Flash.

#### Example of Embedding a Video:
```html
<video controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```
#### Example of Embedding Audio:
```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="song.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  Your browser does not support the audio element.
</audio>
```

- `<video>` and `<audio>`: These elements are used to play video and audio files.
- `controls`: Provides the user with controls to play, pause, and adjust volume.

### 3. **New Input Types in HTML5**
HTML5 introduced new input types that simplify form handling.

#### Example:
```html
<form>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>
  
  <label for="date">Select a date:</label>
  <input type="date" id="date" name="date">
  
  <label for="range">Select a value:</label>
  <input type="range" id="range" name="range" min="0" max="100">
  
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

#### New Input Types:
- `type="email"`: Ensures the input is a valid email address.
- `type="date"`: Allows the user to select a date using a calendar interface.
- `type="range"`: Displays a slider to select a value within a specified range.

### 4. **Form Validation**
HTML5 added built-in form validation without the need for JavaScript.

#### Example:
```html
<form>
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username" required minlength="5">
  
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

- `required`: Forces the user to fill out the field before submitting.
- `

minlength`: Specifies the minimum number of characters allowed in the input.

### 5. **The `<canvas>` Element**
HTML5 introduced the `<canvas>` element for drawing and controlling graphics using JavaScript.

#### Example:
```html
<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>

<script>
  var canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
  var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
  ctx.fillStyle = "#FF0000";
  ctx.fillRect(20, 20, 150, 75);
</script>
```

- `<canvas>`: Used for drawing 2D or 3D graphics using JavaScript.

### 6. **The `<svg>` Element**
The `<svg>` element supports scalable vector graphics, which are used to create graphics.

#### Example:
```html
<svg width="100" height="100">
  <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="black" stroke-width="3" fill="red" />
</svg>
```

- `<svg>`: A container for displaying vector graphics, allowing you to draw shapes like circles and lines.

### **Difference Between HTML and HTML5**

HTML and HTML5 are both markup languages used for structuring and presenting content on the web. However, HTML5 is a major revision of the original HTML, introducing several new features and improvements. Below is a comparison highlighting the key differences between HTML and HTML5:

---

### **1. Multimedia Support**

- **HTML**: To include audio and video in HTML, plugins like Flash were often required.

- **HTML5**: Introduced native support for multimedia elements such as:
    - `<audio>`: To embed sound files.
    - `<video>`: To embed video files.

---

### **2. Semantic Elements**

- **HTML**: Did not have many meaningful tags to describe content. Developers used generic containers like `<div>` for everything.

- **HTML5**: Introduced new semantic elements, which help describe the structure and content of a webpage more clearly:
    - `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, etc.

---

### **3. Form Enhancements**

- **HTML**: Forms required extra JavaScript to validate fields such as email, date, and number.

- **HTML5**: Introduced new form input types and built-in validation, reducing the need for custom JavaScript:
    - New Input Types: `email`, `date`, `url`, `tel`, `range`, `search`, etc.
    - Form attributes like `required`, `pattern`, and `autocomplete` simplify form validation.
---

### **4. Graphics and Animation Support**

- **HTML**: Had no native support for 2D and 3D graphics. Graphics had to be created using external plugins or images.

- **HTML5**: Introduced the `<canvas>` element for drawing 2D shapes and images directly in the browser using JavaScript. It also supports the `<svg>` (Scalable Vector Graphics) element for rendering vector-based graphics.

---

### **5. Offline and Storage Capabilities**

- **HTML**: Did not provide support for offline usage or large data storage in the browser.

- **HTML5**: Introduced new features for offline storage and web application capabilities:
    - **Local Storage**: Allows websites to store data locally on the user's browser, accessible even after the browser is closed.
    - **Session Storage**: Stores data temporarily for a single session.
    - **Cache API**: Allows web applications to work offline.

  #### Example - Local Storage:
  ```javascript
  // HTML5 Local Storage Example
  localStorage.setItem("username", "Eman");
  console.log(localStorage.getItem("username"));  // Outputs: Eman
  ```

---

### **6. Device Compatibility and APIs**

- **HTML**: Had limited support for mobile and device-specific features.

- **HTML5**: Introduced APIs that enable access to device features:
    - **Geolocation API**: To retrieve location data.
    - **Drag and Drop API**: For enhanced user interactions.
    - **Web Workers**: To run JavaScript in the background without affecting page performance.

  #### Example - Geolocation API:
  ```javascript
  // HTML5 Geolocation Example
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
      console.log("Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude);
      console.log("Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude);
    });
  } else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
  }
  ```

---

### **7. Browser Compatibility and Doctype**

- **HTML**: Required a lengthy doctype declaration.

- **HTML5**: Simplified the doctype declaration to one line:
  ```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  ```

---

### **8. Deprecated Elements**

- **HTML**: Used some outdated elements that are no longer considered best practice.
    - Examples: `<font>`, `<center>`, `<big>`, `<blink>`, etc.

- **HTML5**: Deprecated or removed these elements and encouraged the use of CSS for styling and layout.

---

### **Conclusion**
HTML5 is a major upgrade from the original HTML, designed to meet the needs of modern web development. It offers better multimedia support, form handling, and advanced features like offline capabilities and API integration. In addition, HTML5 focuses heavily on making web pages more accessible, responsive, and compatible across different devices, especially mobile.

HTML5 makes web development more efficient and eliminates many of the limitations that existed in earlier versions of HTML.
